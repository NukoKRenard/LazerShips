# Starship Shooting games
This is a game I made from scratch using the OpenGL graphics engine. I did not use a game engine to make this. In this game you play as a blue starship, your goal is to destroy all of the enemy (red) starships.

## Running the game (Windows)
To run the game double click the ```run.bat``` file in the foldr

Please ensure a python 3 interpreter is present on the computer and is a part of path.

**The following packages are required by the game to run. If not installed the ```run.bat``` file will attempt to install them automatically.**
* numpy
* pyglm
* pyopengl
* pygame

To install python packages manually, use the terminal with the command:
```pip install <package-name>```
or
```python -m pip install <package-name>```
